            <h3>We Met</h3>
            <h4>Beijing, 2010</h4>

            <p>
              As the U.S. economy sank to new lows in the depths of
              the Great Recession, both Bion and Diana found themselves
              fleeing to teach English overseas at the Beijing Royal
              School.
            </p>

            <p>
              Diana was asked to greet Bion the night he arrived and
              make sure he got settled in. Unfortunately, she took
              Bus 3 going the wrong direction and didn’t make it ‘til
              late. Bion, never alerted that Diana was meant to greet him,
              was surprised when someone knocked on the door right
              before he was about to jump in the shower, but relieved
              when he discovered she spoke English, and had a working
              phone he could use in the morning.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we think about how lucky we are that our paths
              crossed, we’d really like to give a shout-out to Wall
              Street and real estate speculators everywhere.
            </p>

            <h3>We Dated (Again)</h3>
            <h4>Missoula, 2012</h4>

            <p>
              Bion had just returned to the Northwest after a year in
              Kunming. Diana had just moved to Montana to complete her
              MFA in creative writing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Bion g-chatted Diana up: “A
              friend who is far away is sometimes much nearer than one
              who is at hand. Is not the mountain far more
              awe-inspiring and more clearly visible to one passing
              through the valley than to those who inhabit the
              mountain?”
            </p>

            <p>
              He drove through a few mountain passes with 25 pounds of
              chocolate to give her. She made him a mushroom and leek quiche.
            </p>

            <h3>We’re Getting Married</h3>
            <h4>Seattle, June 24, 2017</h4>

            <p>And we hope you’ll join us to celebrate.</p>
