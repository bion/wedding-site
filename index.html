            </header>
            <h3>We Met</h3>
            <h4>Beijing, 2010</h4>

            <p>
              As the U.S. economy sank to new lows in the depths of
              the Great Recession, both Bion and Diana found themselves
              fleeing to teach English at the Beijing Royal School.
            </p>

            <p>
              Diana was asked to greet Bion the night he arrived and
              make sure he got settled in, but she took
              Bus 3 going the wrong direction and didn’t make it ‘til
              late. Bion, never alerted that Diana was meant to greet him,
              was surprised when someone knocked on the door
              as he was about to shower, but relieved
              to discover she spoke English, and had a working
              phone he could use in the morning.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we think about how lucky it is that our paths
              crossed, we’d really like to give a shout-out to Wall
              Street and real estate speculators everywhere.
            </p>

            <h3>We Dated (Again)</h3>
            <h4>Missoula, 2012</h4>

            <p>
              Bion had just returned to the Northwest after a year in
              Kunming. Diana had just moved to Montana to complete her
              MFA in creative writing.
            </p>

            <p>
              Bion g-chatted Diana up: “A
              friend who is far away is sometimes much nearer than one
              who is at hand. Is not the mountain far more
              awe-inspiring and more clearly visible to one passing
              through the valley than to those who inhabit the
              mountain?”
            </p>

            <p>
              He drove through mountain passes and brought her
              25 pounds of chocolate. She made him a leek and
              mushroom quiche.
            </p>

            <h3>We’re Getting Married</h3>
            <h4>Seattle, June 24, 2017</h4>

            <p>And we hope you’ll join us to celebrate.</p>

              This next year will find us in China, Albania, and
              elsewhere. We're hoping to travel light. Thus we have
              only a few select items. However there are many other
              experiences for which we would love your support. This
              registry with So Kind allows you to purchase items from
              the store of your choice. It also allows you to make
              gifts via PayPal, though additional PayPal charges may
              apply. We also welcome
              traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope" target="_blank">red
              envelopes</a> at the wedding.
